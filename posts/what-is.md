# what is this?

This site is an example of minimalism in software design; otherwise 
known as **conciseness**. 

It's generated using a minimal site generator, called [nix][nix], 
which itself is ~150 lines of pure [ruby][ruby] code.

in common usage and linguistics, concision  (also called conciseness, 
succinctness,[^1] terseness, brevity, or laconicism) is a communication 
principle[^2] of eliminating redundancy,[^3] generally  achieved by using as 
few words as possible in a sentence while preserving its meaning. 

More generally, it is achieved through the omission of parts that 
impart information that was already given, that is obvious or that is 
irrelevant.  Outside of linguistics, a message may be similarly "dense" in 
other forms of communication.

In linguistic research, there have been approaches to analyze the level of 
succinctness of texts using semantic analysis.[^6]

[Blaise Pascal][bp]

> A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary 
> sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary 
> lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer 
> make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his 
> subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.

### Implementation

This blog has 3 pages:

- A post list, the authors CV and the **post itself**
 
- It is focused. it skips fluff and only includes the bare minimums.
- It does one thing but does it well. Semantic HTML, a tiny CSS file with
  respects for dark mode, 
  ARIA accessibility-standards checked, and above all it's tiny hyper 
  performant size.It's file size could be measured in bytes

What you've just read was filler text, half of it being complete bullshit. 
This page seems to render fine. 

Thanks for reading.

Heres a picture of Felix The Housecat to check how images render:

      ""It is a fact that most arguments must try to convince readers, 
      that is the audience, that the arguments are true." Notice the beginning 
      of the sentence: "it is a fact that" doesn't say much; if something is a 
      fact, just present it. 
      So begin the sentence with "most arguments..." 
      and turn to the next bit of overlap. Look at "readers, that is 
      the audience"; the redundancy can be reduced to "readers" or "audience." 
      Now we have "Most arguments must try to convince readers that the 
      arguments are true." Let's get rid of one of the "arguments" to produce 
      "Most arguments must demonstrate (their) truth to readers," or a similarly 
      straightforward expression."
