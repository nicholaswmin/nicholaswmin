## sample-page  

This is a sample `Page`; i.e: not a `Post`.   

It's is written in `Markdown` but doesn't support    
code syntax highlighting nor is it included in any Post lists.   

You can add as many as you want within this folder.    
Just like a `Post`, it requires an `h2` header at the top.
