# nix

> minimal static-site generator in 150 lines of [ruby][ruby]

```raw
Usage: nix [options]

nix  --init              create sample blog
nix  --build             build static HTML
nix  --watch             rebuild on file change

example:

$ ruby nix.rb --init
```

## quick start 
 
- create a repo for your site, blog, whatever ...
- just drop the [nix.rb](#get-nix) file in it.

then:

> generate a minimal sample blog:

```bash
ruby nix.rb --init
```

## write posts

- add [markdown][gfm] posts in `/posts`
- add [markdown][gfm] pages in `/pages`
- add images, videos, CSS in `/public`

> posts include [syntax highlighting][rouge]

> build to static HTML, at `/build`

```bash
ruby nix.rb --build
# build ok!
```

or even better:

> rebuild automatically on file change

```bash
ruby nix.rb --watch
```

## publish it

Just push to `main`. 

An autogenerated Github workflow will run `nix --build` to compile   
everything once-more & deploy at: https://username.github.io/repo-name.

> `/build` directory ia recompiled on `push` so you can safely `.gitignore`
> it entirely.

## post format

just make sure each page or post has:

- an `h1` title on the 1st line
- an `empty line` on the 2nd line
- a `<date>` on the 3rd, ie. `2024-10-18`

the rest is up to you.

> example:

```markdown
# Some pretentious post title
 
2024-12-20

> A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary 
> sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines 
> and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all 
> his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only 
> in outline, but that every word tell

### get nix

`nix` is just a single-file; it's max 150 lines of code & it includes everything 
necessary to develop and publish a [ridicously minimal][club] yet functional 
blog site. 

grab it from this repo [directly][download], or just `curl` it:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicholaswmin/nix/main/nix.rb
```

apart from [Ruby 3.3][ruby] there's nothing to install; 
nor any commands to run. You don't need to run `gem install`. 
It's not available as a `gem` either; 

This is [intentional](#wheres-the-rest-of-it)

## Quirks

### Asset paths

Don't use absolute paths to reference assets.   

Github Pages has a well-known quirk of serving from a non-root path,
applicable to all static-site generators.

this won't work:

```html
<img src="/public/felix.svg"></img>
<img src="/felix.svg"></img>
```

use relative paths instead:

```html
<img src="../../felix.svg"></img>
```

even better, use `{{root_url)}`:

```html
<img src="{{root_path}}/felix.svg"></img>
<!-- auto expands to <img src="../../felix.svg"></img> -->
```

it's rewritten automatically & resolves to the correct root regardless of 
the page position, so it's less error-prone than manually writing relative   
paths.

> same in markdown:

```md
[1]: {{root_url}}felix.svg
```

### root resolution in ruby

> in case you're extending `nix`:

`root_url` is also available as a method 
which has the same effect:

```ruby
root_url('felix.svg')
# ../../felix.svg
```

more context:

```ruby
class CustomPage < HTMLPage
  # omitted ...

  def render(ctx)
    super + 
      "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"#{root_url('highlight.css')}\"><link>"
  end
end
```

## Wheres the rest of it?

The idea behind it closely mimics [wruby](https://wruby.passthejoe.net/about/),
a static-site generator that generates [sites that are under 1kb][club].

While the whole thing looks more like a code-golfing joke than anything 
substantial, it's philosophy is based around serious ideas that emerged 
in MIT and Berkley around the 80s(?), regarding software architecture design. 

Despite their similarities. `wruby` is written entirely procedurally. 
There is a clear *lack* of architecture and you can more or less describe it
as a cooking recipe.

This project rewrites its core ideas in an [Object-Oriented paradigm][oop], 
but to avoid the irony of the entire argument, it's written with "care" not to 
introduce excessive abstractions or any highly esoteric ideas from 
object-orientation; it uses standard [polymorphism][polymor] and 
[encapsulation][encapsulation] to express it's architecture; although OOP
is taking some flack the past decade (or more?) from functional-programming,
and rightfully so IMO; these 2 are not debatable characteristics of OOP, they
are the most accepted ones.

`nix` is using a lot of ideas supposedly considered "Best Practices".
Data is moved around in a functional manner; the API is implemented in a fluent
prose with clear hierarchical organisation into classes/types. Additionally,
there's a clear and intentional separation of concerns between persistence code 
and logic code; the purpose of this is to make it amerable to unit-testing.

`wruby` has *absolutely none* of the above.  
it's really just a bunch of functions glued together.   
It's not possible to extend it without pulling out your hair. 

With that being said, wruby is one of the few projects that I sat through 
reading it's entire source-code without getting bored or distracted, because 
it is just *that* simple.

Both projects are written in Ruby.
Both projects are based on material from the following essays:

- [Worse is Better][worse-is-better], [Richard P. Gabriel][rpg)
- [Is Worse Really Better?][worse-better], Richard P. Gabriel
- [Locality of Behavior][loc-behavior], Carson Gross
- [Chesterson's Fence: A lesson in thinking][chest-fence]

From the Unix-Haters handbook    
[Simson Garfinkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simson_Garfinkel)

> [...] Literature that Unix succeeded because of its technical superiority. 
> This is not true. Unix was evolutionarily superior to its competitors, 
> but not technically superior. Unix became a commercial success because 
> it was a virus. 
> Its sole evolutionary advantage was its small size, simple design, and 
> resulting portability.

> ### From [Worse is Better vs The Right Thing][worse-is-better]  
>
> The New Jersey style of software architecture design    
> vs the MIT/Stanford approach   
>
> [Richard P. Gabriel][rpg], 1991  
>
> [... ]I and just about every designer of Common Lisp and CLOS has
> had extreme exposure to the MIT/Stanford style of design. 
> The essence of this style can be captured by the phrase *The Right Thing*. 
> To such a designer it is important to get all of the following characteristics 
> right:
>
> #### Simplicity
> the design must be simple, both in implementation and interface. 
> It is more important for the interface to be simple than the implementation.
>
> #### Correctness 
> The design must be correct in all observable aspects. Incorrectness is simply 
> not allowed.
>
> #### Consistency
> The design must not be inconsistent. 
> A design is allowed to be slightly less simple and less complete to avoid 
> inconsistency. Consistency is as important as correctness.
>
> #### Completeness
> The design must cover as many important situations as is 
> practical. All reasonably expected cases must be covered. 
> Simplicity is not allowed to overly reduce completeness.
>

    ## sample

    This is a sample `Page`; i.e: not a `Post`.   

    It's is written in `Markdown` but doesn't support    
    code syntax highlighting nor is it included in any Post lists.   

    You can add as many as you want within this folder.    
    Just like a `Post`, it requires an `h2` header at the top.

- posts/whats-this.md: |
    # whats this?

    21-10-2021

    This is a sample post, written in [github-flavored markdown][gfm].

    It's generated using a minimal static-site generator, 
    called [nix][nix], which itself is ~150 lines of [ruby][ruby] code.

    Here's how it renders:

    This is a footnote[^1]

    A horizontal ruler follows:

    ---

    ## This is an h2 header

    ### This is an h3 header

    #### This is an h4 header

    ... and this is a blockquote:

    > A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary 
    > sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary 
    > lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer 
    > make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his 
    > subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.

    ## Syntax highlighting

    posts include syntax highlighting, via [pygments][pyg]:

    Javascript

    ```js
    let fact = 1

    for (i = 1; i <= number; i++)
      fact *= i

    console.log(`The factorial of ${number} is ${fact}.`)
    ```

    Ruby


    ```ruby
    a = [:foo, 'bar', 2]

    a.reverse_each do |element| 
    puts "#{element.class} #{element}" 
    end
    ```

    Bash

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    i=1
    while [[ $i -le 10 ]] ; do
    echo "$i"
    (( i += 1 ))
    done
    ```

    ## More

    this is a list:

    - Oranges
    - Apples
    - Peaches

    ... and this is an SVG image of **Felix The Housecat**:


    ![Felix the Housecat, the cartoon]({{root_url}}felix.svg "Felix the Housecat")

    This project was inspired by: The [1kb club][1kb].
