<p>This site is an example of minimalism in software design; otherwise <br />
known as <strong>conciceness</strong>.</p>

<p>in common usage and linguistics, concision  (also called conciseness, <br />
succinctness,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> terseness, brevity, or laconicism) is a communication <br />
principle<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> of eliminating redundancy,<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> generally  achieved by using as <br />
few words as possible in a sentence while preserving its meaning.</p>

<p>More generally, it is achieved through the omission of parts that <br />
impart information that was already given, that is obvious or that is <br />
irrelevant.  Outside of linguistics, a message may be similarly “dense” in <br />
other forms of communication.</p>

<p>In linguistic research, there have been approaches to analyze the level of <br />
succinctness of texts using semantic analysis.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have made this longer than usual, only because I have not <br />
had the time to make it shorter.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary <br />
sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary <br />
lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer <br />
make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his <br />
subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.</p>

<p>Minimalism is not the absence of function; it is a very strict focus on what <br />
is important. Running out of gas on the highway is not an expression of<br />
minimalism in gasoline consumption. You just run out of gas because you are <br />
the type of person to run out of gas.</p>

<p>Minimalism in i.e: Interior Design means your guests get to sit comfortably, <br />
there’s a feeling that it happens a bit like magic - the whole setup <br />
doesn’t look like it could accomodate people like that, yet there it is.</p>

<p>In it’s best implementation, your guests would be unaware of the functions<br />
themselves as the entire setup is immersive enough for them to get on<br />
with whatever they were supposed to be doing without stopping to think about<br />
the tool itself, in this case the furniture.</p>

<p>This blog has 3 pages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A post list, the authors CV</p>
  </li>
  <li>It is focused. it skips fluff and only includes the bare minimums.</li>
  <li>It does one thing but does it well. Semantic HTML, a tiny CSS file with<br />
respects for dark mode, <br />
ARIA accessibility-standards checked, and above all it’s tiny hyper <br />
performant size.It’s file size could be measured in bytes</li>
</ul>

<p>What you’ve just read was filler text, my thoughts and some wikipedia<br />
copypasta. This page seems to render fine. Thanks.</p>

<p>By the way this is how images render here:</p>
